# Framew'ork 

common code base / library for ltb projects 

This covers the 3 following projects

* <https://github.com/ltb-project/white-pages>
* <https://github.com/ltb-project/service-desk>
* <https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password>

Starting point : identifying code to factorize for all this project and maintain a coherent unified naming convention.

Usage of this framework in projects will be done in a **framew1ork** branch until it becomes default.
